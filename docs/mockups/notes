IdentityDAO User Flow Mockups:
===============================

-Emphasis on high-level, user experience and end product
-Utilize their current seed phrase method for login (for the moment)


Flows for IdentityDAO integration:
-Create account (for verification flow)
-Create/Update/Remove Proposal UI
-Use https://dapp.gooddollar.org/ as a baseline


Currently implemented GoodDollar flow:

-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name) ----> Phone verification
-Login ---> Enter seed phrase ---> Main app page (landing)
