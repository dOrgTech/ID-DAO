IdentityDAO User Flow Mockups:
===============================

-Emphasis on high-level, user experience and end product
-Utilize their current seed phrase method for login (for the moment)


Flows for IdentityDAO integration:
-Create account (for verification flow)
-Create/Update/Remove Proposal UI
-Use https://dapp.gooddollar.org/ as a baseline


Currently implemented GoodDollar flow:
---------------------------------------
-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name) ----> Phone verification
-Login ---> Enter seed phrase ---> Main app page (landing) 


Propective flow:
-----------------
-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name, Email) AND account verification text boxes (Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter [ Verify (button)* ]) ---> Approval sent!** 

* Mini-flow of [ Verify ] ---> Instructions page ---> (in new tab) Path for doing on-platform verifying (such as tweeting a unique code) ---> Enter details page
** Send email confirming approval sending, and give seed phrase. At this point, the user has an account on GoodDollar, simply not approved (and can access approval status in this way)
