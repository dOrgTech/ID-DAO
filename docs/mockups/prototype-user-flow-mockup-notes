IdentityDAO User Flow Mockups:
===============================

-Emphasis on high-level, user experience and end product
-Utilize their current seed phrase method for login (for the moment)

1. Currently Implemented GoodDollar Flow *
2. Prospective Flow *
3. User Flows in Detail
  *. Account Verification Flows
4. Additional Considerations



*NOTE: These two are replicated in the current "notes" document, done here for convenience, may be moved over here, making the "notes" something reserved for the research on user flows piece.


Currently Implemented GoodDollar Flow:
---------------------------------------
-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name) ----> Phone verification
-Login ---> Enter seed phrase ---> Main app page (landing)


Prospective Flow:
------------------
-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name, Email) AND account verification text boxes (Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter [ Verify (button)* ]) ---> Approval sent!**

* Mini-flow of [ Verify ] ---> Instructions page ---> (in new tab) Path for doing on-platform verifying (such as tweeting a unique code) ---> Enter details page
** Send email confirming approval sending, and give seed phrase. At this point, the user has an account on GoodDollar, simply not approved (and can access approval status in this way)

TODO: Identity flow for creating raw proposals without necessarily needing to be logged in (make sure not intrusive/difficult for new user)

Additional Considerations
---------------------------
-Password vs. wallet phrase
  -Alternatively, PIN/phone number
  -(Forgot PIN?)
    -Seed reserved for backup

-Editing information/Deleting Information - will this reflect in user flow?
  -Why would a user edit/delete information?
    -Updating public address?
  -Expiring identities as a solution ()

-Allow GoodDollar users to vote on other users?
  -Disagree - can prevent mass market to shoot this out as a DAO, simply keep as this identity verification

-User flow for User Flow that is already on already on registry, import identity somehow
  -Think of perspective from an attacker - make sure user *can't* be on the list twice
  -Maybe if non-malicious - propose a deletion/edit of an identity?
    -Issue - if malicious, then they can simply say "hey, my identity was stolen! please approve me to steal UBI funds" (much like phone company phishing)

-Should a seperate address (sender) be able to add/edit/delete identity of another person? (e.g. From 0x984: Add 0x100 to registry)
  -Could have malicious element
  -However, making it this way allows entities/dApps to add identities on their behalf
    -Otherwise, GoodDollar will have to hold private keys on-chain

-Make sure distinguish between on-server privacy, and on-chain Identity Registry

-Phone number - not strong, because someone can make identity Identity

-What unique info can we keep on-chain that will ensure non-duplicate identities
