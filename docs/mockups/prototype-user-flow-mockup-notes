-Utilize their current seed phrase method for login (for the moment)

Currently Implemented GoodDollar Flow:
---------------------------------------
-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name) ----> Phone verification
-Login ---> Enter seed phrase ---> Main app page (landing)


========================================================

User Scenarios
---------------

Basic 

-Initial Account Creation
-User with GoodDollar account (signing in)
-New user verifying identity
-User wants to edit identity
-User wants to remove identity

Exception Scenarios

-User forgot their PIN
-User with rejected approval
-User with existing GoodDollar attempting to register
  -User with existing IdentityRegistry attempting to register
  -(NOTE: Leave this out for now)
  -(Loose assumption that GoodDollar is the only one connected to IdentityRegistry (we live in GoodDollar land!))

Security Scenarios

-Malicious user attempting to enter existing GoodDollar (attack on recovery option)


========================================================


Prospective Flow:
------------------

============================  
Basic
============================

Initial Account Creation

  Create Account ---> Choose a PIN ---> (Optional) Fingerprint/FaceID? (mobile) ---> Enter minimal details (Full Name, Email) ---> Account Landing Page 

===

Log-in Process (signing in)

  Main Landing Page ---> Enter PIN (or Fingerprint/FaceID) ---> Account Landing Page

===

Identity Verification for User (New user verifying identity)

  Account Landing Page ---> (Action that triggers/forces identity) ---> Identity (address, all information, ID card*, camera image (e.g. holding paper with timestamp)**) and account verification text boxes (Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter [ Verify (button)*** ]) ---> Approval sent!****

  * Mini-flow of ID Document Verification

    Brief Instructions and Select an ID type (Driver's license, ID card, Passport) ---> Select an upload method (Webcam/Mobile Camera (a), File Upload (b)) ---> Next

      a. Webcam/Mobile Camera
        Instructions on Photo (e.g. ID card in line with square borders) and Camera Screen ---> Use this photo? (can be in same modal/screen) ---> Next

      b. File Upload
        Brief instructions on file upload, click/drag image ---> Use this image? ---> Next

  ** Mini-flow of Photo Identity Verification

    Brief Instructions and Select an upload method (Webcam/Mobile Camera (a), File Upload (b)) ---> Next

      a. Webcam/Mobile Camera
        Instructions on Photo (e.g. face in camera) and Camera Screen ---> Use this photo? (can be in same modal/screen) ---> Next

      b. File Upload
        Brief instructions on file upload, click/drag image ---> Use this image? ---> Next


  *** Mini-flow of Individual Account Verification

    [ Verify ] ---> Instructions page ---> (in new tab) Path for doing on-platform verifying (such as tweeting a unique code) ---> Enter details page

  (Extra note)
  **** Send email confirming approval sending, and give seed phrase. At this point, the user has an account on GoodDollar, simply not approved (and can access approval status in this way)


On upcoming proposal:
=====================

-Account verification - will we be checking to see if the tweet is valid, or should we pass this responsibility onto the DAO?
  -[ ANSWER IN UPCOMING PROTOTYPE ]
  -Note: Look at HumanityDAO

-Where do the blobs of data live?
  -Type of data
  -Add example JSON, pseudocode (check the chat explanation)
  -...And how it will show to the user

-Mockups of user experience
  -e.g. mockup of the email

===


============================  
Exception Scenarios
============================

User forgot their PIN

  Main Landing Page ---> Log In (forgot your PIN?) ---> Options (Restore account with seed backup*, Contact support**) 

  * Mini-flow of Seed Backup
  
    Enter Seed ---> Enter a new PIN ---> Success! Try logging in again ---> Log in page (perhaps redirect) 

  ** Mini-flow of Contact Support
   
    Restore Account Support Instructions and Information ("Contact us at support@gooddollar.org to... Please provide the following: ")

===

User with rejected approval

  Main Landing Page ---> Log In ---> Main Landing Page ---> Identity Verification (status, resend approval) ---> Review details (Revise*, Submit) ---> Approval re-sent! 

  * Mini-flow of Identity Approval Revision

    Revise information (fields filled in with last approval's data) ---> Review details (Revise*, Submit)

===

User with existing GoodDollar attempting to register

  Create Account ---> Choose a PIN ---> (Optional) Fingerprint/FaceID? (mobile) ---> Enter minimal details (Full Name, Email) ---> Already in our system! (Login*, Restore account**)

  * Mini-flow of entire "Log in" scenario
  ** Mini-flow of entire "User forgot their PIN" scenario
