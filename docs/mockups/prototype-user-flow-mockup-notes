2. Prospective Flow *
3. User Flows in Detail

*NOTE: These two are replicated in the current "notes" document, done here for convenience, may be moved over here, making the "notes" something reserved for the research on user flows piece.


Currently Implemented GoodDollar Flow:
---------------------------------------
-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name) ----> Phone verification
-Login ---> Enter seed phrase ---> Main app page (landing)


Prospective Flow:
------------------
-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name, Email) AND account verification text boxes (Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter [ Verify (button)* ]) ---> Approval sent!**

* Mini-flow of [ Verify ] ---> Instructions page ---> (in new tab) Path for doing on-platform verifying (such as tweeting a unique code) ---> Enter details page
** Send email confirming approval sending, and give seed phrase. At this point, the user has an account on GoodDollar, simply not approved (and can access approval status in this way)
