Currently Implemented GoodDollar Flow:
---------------------------------------
-Create a wallet ---> Enter details (Full Name) ----> Phone verification
-Login ---> Enter seed phrase ---> Main app page (landing)


========================================================

User Scenarios
---------------

Basic 

-Initial Account Creation
-User with GoodDollar account (signing in)
-New user verifying identity

Exception Scenarios

-User forgot their PIN
-User with rejected approval
-User with existing GoodDollar attempting to register
  -User with existing IdentityRegistry attempting to register
  -(NOTE: Leave this out for now)
  -(Loose assumption that GoodDollar is the only one connected to IdentityRegistry (we live in GoodDollar land!))

Security Scenarios

-Malicious user attempting to enter existing GoodDollar (attack on recovery option)


(User Scenarios for GoodDollar Prototype Proposal)
----------------------------------------------------

Basic

-Initial Account Creation
-User with GoodDollar account (signing in)
-New user verifying identity

Exception Scenarios

-User forgot their PIN
-User with rejected approval
-User with existing GoodDollar attempting to register


========================================================


Prospective Flow:
------------------

============================  
Basic
============================

Initial Account Creation

  Create Account ---> Choose a PIN ---> (Optional) Fingerprint/FaceID? (mobile) ---> Enter minimal details (Full Name, Email) ---> Account Landing Page 

===

Log-in Process (signing in)

  Main Landing Page ---> Enter PIN ---> Account Landing Page

===

Identity Verification for User (New user verifying identity)

  Account Landing Page ---> Identity (address, all information, ID card*, camera image**) and account verification text boxes (Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter [ Verify (button)*** ]) ---> Approval sent!****

  * Mini-flow of ID Document Verification

    Brief Instructions and Select an ID type (Driver's license, ID card, Passport) ---> Select an upload method (Webcam/Mobile Camera (a), File Upload (b)) ---> Next

      a. Webcam/Mobile Camera
        Instructions on Photo (e.g. ID card in line with square borders) and Camera Screen ---> Use this photo? (can be in same modal/screen) ---> Next

      b. File Upload
        Brief instructions on file upload, click/drag image ---> Use this image? ---> Next

  ** Mini-flow of Photo Identity Verification

    Brief Instructions and Select an upload method (Webcam/Mobile Camera (a), File Upload (b)) ---> Next

      a. Webcam/Mobile Camera
        Instructions on Photo (e.g. face in camera) and Camera Screen ---> Use this photo? (can be in same modal/screen) ---> Next

      b. File Upload
        Brief instructions on file upload, click/drag image ---> Use this image? ---> Next


  *** Mini-flow of Individual Account Verification

    [ Verify ] ---> Instructions page ---> (in new tab) Path for doing on-platform verifying (such as tweeting a unique code) ---> Enter details page

  (Extra note)
  **** Send email confirming approval sending, and give seed phrase. At this point, the user has an account on GoodDollar, simply not approved (and can access approval status in this way)

============================  
Exception Scenarios
============================

User forgot their PIN



User with rejected approval




User with existing GoodDollar attempting to register

Additional Considerations
---------------------------
-Password vs. wallet phrase
  -Alternatively, PIN/phone number
  -(Forgot PIN?)
    -Seed reserved for backup

-Editing information/Deleting Information - will this reflect in user flow?
  -Why would a user edit/delete information?
    -Updating public address?
  -Expiring identities as a solution ()

-Allow GoodDollar users to vote on other users (on the app, makes person feel like "a good citizen")?
  -Disagree - can prevent mass market to shoot this out as a DAO, simply keep as this identity verification

-User flow for User Flow that is already on already on registry, import identity somehow
  -Think of perspective from an attacker - make sure user *can't* be on the list twice
  -Maybe if non-malicious - propose a deletion/edit of an identity?
    -Issue - if malicious, then they can simply say "hey, my identity was stolen! please approve me to steal UBI funds" (much like phone company phishing)

-Should a seperate address (sender) be able to add/edit/delete identity of another person? (e.g. From 0x984: Add 0x100 to registry)
  -Could have malicious element
  -However, making it this way allows entities/dApps to add identities on their behalf
    -Otherwise, GoodDollar will have to hold private keys on-chain
  -Yes! 
    -Allow people to remove other people (counteract malicious entity)
    -What if someone dies? No access to key
    -Perhaps only can add yourself?
      -Can work around this by having GoodDollar accept a signature, GoodDollar submits

-Make sure distinguish between on-server privacy, and on-chain Identity Registry

-Phone number - not strong, because someone can make identity Identity

-What unique info can we keep on-chain that will ensure non-duplicate identities

-If logged in and still waiting for approval (and approval rejected), (Contact Us for Support if not approved)

(This is copied from above; may not be relevant due to discussion above) TODO: Identity flow for creating raw proposals without necessarily needing to be logged in (make sure not intrusive/difficult for new user)

=============
META-NOTE:     Go for something, don't keep additional considerations in the document, make trade-offs to give coherent picture and avoid uncertainty (consulting comes from us)
